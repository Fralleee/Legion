- Should be able to cancel build when in placeable-mode
- Bind new input: Cancel: Escape and Cancel: Mouse2
  Use this new input button to cancel builds

So.. I have initialized game manager, as of now it syncs state with game data and builder actually listens to the state.
What needs to be done, the actual buildings should spawn nigguz when state changes to Live
We need AI
oh god.. need lots of stuff


# GameControls
- LiveStart: 
  Iterate through runtime sets (buildings) and replace the building character model with actual character and activate animation
	
- LiveUpdate:
	After small delay add the old model and slowly apply dissolve to make it visible

# AI
- NavMesh
- TakeDamage
- Attack
- Caster
	When given an ability and target => Cast spell (play animation, apply blockers, turn towards target, e.t.c)



# Caster
- Create caster behaviour, kind of same as Builder
- Make castable scriptableobject
  - Cooldown
  - Cost
  - Spell prefab (ISpell)  
- Try reconstructing Launch as an ability instead
  Probably need an enum that says AbilityType [Default, Attack, Ultimate]

  
# Damageable
- Implement damage & health

# Caster
- Simple damaging script
  





# Improve character
