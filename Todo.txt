# Changes
- Abilities should track their own shit:
  - AbilityType (projectile, direct, target ... <- use inheritance)
  - TargetFinding (use extension classes)
	- TargetPriority
	- Timers: cooldown, windup, recovery, lastCast, scanRate, losScanRate (better names for these)...
	- Statistics: range, min amount, max amount, effectsList?
  
	Three types of target: 
	- Objective (travel target, main objective of unit, last prioritized when casting)
	- MainTarget (target that is focused by mainAttack and most damage spells, chase target)
	- CurrentTarget (target currently focused by heal, other spells with different priority)
	
  DamageAbilities should always prioritize mainAttack-target
	
	
- Replace current system with scriptableobjects type


- Use different types of target priority (distance, health, armorType e.t.c.)

- Create a static class that looks for targets by using extensions

- Remove old code if not needed






# Build system
- Rename placeable

# UI
- Build UI should be activated based on Event/State
  Build controls should be:
	LMB: Upgrade
	RMB: Sell
	1-6: Basic units	
	Q: Last unit
	E: ???
	R: Ultimate unit 1
	F: Ultimate unit 2	
- When a spell/building cannot be cast/afforded it should be red

# AI animations
- Maybe have multiple animations (regular and BR)
- Movement animations (should just require forward, maybe turning?)
- Use Root motion or not?
- Attack animation for ranged and melee

# ActionController (player)
- Create caster behaviour, kind of same as Builder
- Make castable scriptableobject
  - Cooldown
  - Cost
  - Spell prefab (ISpell)  
- Try reconstructing Launch as an ability instead
  Probably need an enum that says AbilityType [Default, Attack, Ultimate]

# Ability UI
- Ability UI should have functionality Flashing, where it indicates with a pulsating glowing border and shine.
  
# Death ragdoll
