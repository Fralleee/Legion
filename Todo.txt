# Actions
+ Use castTime on Action before getting the result

- CREATE COPIES
- Ensure that scriptableobjects are copied on setup and not used as references
  Use two frostwarriors that attack two different monsters
  Ensure that cooldown does not affect them both

	
# Blocker
- Remake how blockers are used, instead use a component: BlockerController
	
	
	
	
# Remove Ability-code (replaced by UnitAction)
- Add Logic for LoS (TryPerform == false => nextAction || try to find LoS (only if mainAttack))
- TryPerform on action

# GameControls
- LiveStart: Spawn soldiers from buildings
  Iterate through runtime sets (buildings) and replace the building character model with actual character and activate animation
	
- LiveUpdate: 
	After small delay add the old model and slowly apply dissolve to make it visible

# AI
- NavMesh
- TakeDamage
- Attack
- Caster
	When given an ability and target => Cast spell (play animation, apply blockers, turn towards target, e.t.c)



# Caster
- Create caster behaviour, kind of same as Builder
- Make castable scriptableobject
  - Cooldown
  - Cost
  - Spell prefab (ISpell)  
- Try reconstructing Launch as an ability instead
  Probably need an enum that says AbilityType [Default, Attack, Ultimate]

# Ability UI
- Ability UI should have functionality Flashing, where it indicates with a pulsating glowing border and shine.
  
# Damageable
- Implement damage & health

# Caster
- Simple damaging script
