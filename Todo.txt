# Actions, LineOfSight, Testing	
- AIMotor: Should be able to move around obstacles to get in line of sight
- TestCase: 
	Have two units. 
	One has LoS ability with Range as MainAbility. One has ranged Ability without LoS as MainAbility
	Both of them have secondary ability that is ranged.
	Both of the try to attack a target behind a wall.
	The one with LoS main should run towards target, shooting abilities on the way.
	The other should only shoot ranged ability which can hit the enemy.
	
	
	
# GameControls
- LiveStart: Spawn soldiers from buildings
  Iterate through runtime sets (buildings) and replace the building character model with actual character and activate animation
- LiveUpdate: 
	After small delay add the old model and slowly apply dissolve to make it visible

	
# AI animations


# ActionController (player)
- Create caster behaviour, kind of same as Builder
- Make castable scriptableobject
  - Cooldown
  - Cost
  - Spell prefab (ISpell)  
- Try reconstructing Launch as an ability instead
  Probably need an enum that says AbilityType [Default, Attack, Ultimate]

	
# Ability UI
- Ability UI should have functionality Flashing, where it indicates with a pulsating glowing border and shine.
