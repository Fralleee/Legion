+ Glödande particles
+ Character rotation utanför smoothdamp
+ Fixa in CameraShake
+ Gamemanager som scriptableobject
+ Review all code, move duplicate code to Fralle.Core if mainstream
+ Refactor code to use utils code and extensions	
+ Split Builder into two, one that performs actions and one that gathers input
+ Remade GameEvent
+ UI has no control over activation of placeable, instead it just sets ActiveBuilding and raises events

- Remove old GameEvents
	

	
	

# GameControls
- Start State: 
  Iterate through runtime sets (buildings) and replace the building character model with actual character and activate animation
	After small delay add the old model and slowly apply dissolve to make it visible

# AI
- NavMesh
- TakeDamage
- Attack
- Caster
	When given an ability and target => Cast spell (play animation, apply blockers, turn towards target, e.t.c)



# Caster
- Create caster behaviour, kind of same as Builder
- Make castable scriptableobject
  - Cooldown
  - Cost
  - Spell prefab (ISpell)  
- Try reconstructing Launch as an ability instead
  Probably need an enum that says AbilityType [Default, Attack, Ultimate]
