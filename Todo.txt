# CastAnimation
- Each animation should have an AnimationEvent that triggers the ability cast instead of relying on timers'
  How to make this work dynamically with windup timer and such :S


# Changes
- Use different types of target priority (distance, health, armorType e.t.c.)


# Build system
- Rename placeable

# UI
- Build UI should be activated based on Event/State
  Build controls should be:
	LMB: Upgrade
	RMB: Sell
	1-6: Basic units	
	Q: Last unit
	E: ???
	R: Ultimate unit 1
	F: Ultimate unit 2	
- When a spell/building cannot be cast/afforded it should be red

# AI animations
- Maybe have multiple animations (regular and BR)
- Movement animations (should just require forward, maybe turning?)
- Use Root motion or not?
- Attack animation for ranged and melee

# ActionController (player)
- Create caster behaviour, kind of same as Builder
- Make castable scriptableobject
  - Cooldown
  - Cost
  - Spell prefab (ISpell)  
- Try reconstructing Launch as an ability instead
  Probably need an enum that says AbilityType [Default, Attack, Ultimate]

# Ability UI
- Ability UI should have functionality Flashing, where it indicates with a pulsating glowing border and shine.
  
# Death ragdoll
