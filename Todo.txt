# AI animations
- Movement animations (should just require forward, maybe turning?)
- Use Root motion or not?
- Attack animation for ranged and melee
- Create new unit that uses ranged

# GameControls
- LiveStart: Spawn soldiers from buildings
  Iterate through runtime sets (buildings) and replace the building character model with actual character and activate animation
- LiveUpdate: 
	After small delay add the old model and slowly apply dissolve to make it visible

	


# ActionController (player)
- Create caster behaviour, kind of same as Builder
- Make castable scriptableobject
  - Cooldown
  - Cost
  - Spell prefab (ISpell)  
- Try reconstructing Launch as an ability instead
  Probably need an enum that says AbilityType [Default, Attack, Ultimate]

	
# Ability UI
- Ability UI should have functionality Flashing, where it indicates with a pulsating glowing border and shine.
