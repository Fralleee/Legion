- AIMotor: Should be able to move around obstacles to get in line of sight

- TestCase: 
	Have two units. 
	One has LoS ability with Range as MainAbility. One has ranged Ability without LoS as MainAbility
	Both of them have secondary ability that is ranged.
	Both of the try to attack a target behind a wall.

# GameControls

  Iterate through runtime sets (buildings) and replace the building character model with actual character and activate animation

# AI
- NavMesh
- TakeDamage
- Attack
- Caster
	When given an ability and target => Cast spell (play animation, apply blockers, turn towards target, e.t.c)



# Caster
- Create caster behaviour, kind of same as Builder
- Make castable scriptableobject
  - Cooldown
  - Cost
  - Spell prefab (ISpell)  
- Try reconstructing Launch as an ability instead
  Probably need an enum that says AbilityType [Default, Attack, Ultimate]
