So.. I have initialized game manager, as of now it syncs state with game data and builder actually listens to the state.
What needs to be done, the actual buildings should spawn nigguz when state changes to Live
We need AI
oh god.. need lots of stuff


# GameControls
- LiveStart: 
  Iterate through runtime sets (buildings) and replace the building character model with actual character and activate animation
	
- LiveUpdate:
	After small delay add the old model and slowly apply dissolve to make it visible

# AI
- NavMesh
- TakeDamage
- Attack
- Caster
	When given an ability and target => Cast spell (play animation, apply blockers, turn towards target, e.t.c)



# Caster
- Create caster behaviour, kind of same as Builder
- Make castable scriptableobject
  - Cooldown
  - Cost
  - Spell prefab (ISpell)  
- Try reconstructing Launch as an ability instead
  Probably need an enum that says AbilityType [Default, Attack, Ultimate]

# Ability UI
- Ability UI should have functionality Flashing, where it indicates with a pulsating glowing border and shine.
  
# Damageable
- Implement damage & health

# Caster
- Simple damaging script
  





# Improve character

## Much Laters
# Damageable
- Implement damage directions
  Animate accordingly

# Launch
  - Figure out why you get blocked sometimes
  - Sometimes it bugs when landing on uneven terrain
  
# Controller
- Turn when above certain degree (45deg-)
  Otherwise turn characters upper body towards direction

# InventorySystem
- Kolla unitegrejerna

# Armor/damage types
- Use scriptableobjects, ryan hipple => elements talk (unite 2017)

# Game Info
- THE WIZARD MUST BE STOPPED
- Orange vs Blue
- Last boss: The Wizard
